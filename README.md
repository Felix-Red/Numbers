# Lotto Number Generator

My grandfather buys a lotto ticket every Friday, and he loves asking me to give him numbers he should select for his ticket. To help him out, I created a system that generates lotto numbers.

## Features
- Random Number Generation: Generates a set of random numbers for lotto tickets.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
